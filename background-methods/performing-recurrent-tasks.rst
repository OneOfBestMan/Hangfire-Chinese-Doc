Performing recurrent tasks
===========================

Recurring job registration is just as simple as background job registration â€“ you only need to write a single line of code:

.. code-block:: c#

   RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate(() => Console.Write("Easy!"), Cron.Daily);

This line creates a new entry in persistant storage. A special component in Hangfire Server (see :doc:`../background-processing/processing-background-jobs`) checks the recurring jobs on a minute-based interval and then enqueues them as fire-and-forget jobs. This enables you to track them as usual.

.. admonition:: Make sure your app always running
   :class: warning

   Your Hangfire Server instance should be always on to perform scheduling and processing logic. If you perform the processing inside an ASP.NET application, please also read the :doc:`../deployment-to-production/making-aspnet-app-always-running` chapter.

The ``Cron`` class contains different methods and overloads to run jobs on a minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis. You can also use `CRON expressions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression>`_ to specify a more complex schedule:

.. code-block:: c#

   RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate(() => Console.Write("Powerful!"), "0 12 * */2");

Specifying identifiers
-----------------------

Each recurring job has its own unique identifier. In the previous examples it was  generated implicitly, using the type and method names of the given call expression (resulting in ``"Console.Write"`` as the identifier). The ``RecurringJob`` class contains overloads that take an explicitly defined job identifier.  So that you can refer to the job later.

.. code-block:: c#

   RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate("some-id", () => Console.WriteLine(), Cron.Hourly);

The call to ``AddOrUpdate`` method will create a new recurring job or update existing job with the same identifier.

.. admonition:: Identifiers should be unique
   :class: warning

   Use unique identifiers for each recurring job, otherwise you'll end with a single job.

.. admonition:: Identifiers may be case sensitive
   :class: note

   Recurring job identifier may be **case sensitive** in some storage implementations.

Manipulating recurring jobs
----------------------------

You can remove an existing recurring job by calling the ``RemoveIfExists`` method. It does not throw an exception when there is no such recurring job.

.. code-block:: c#

   RecurringJob.RemoveIfExists("some-id");

To run a recurring job now, call the ``Trigger`` method. The information about triggered invocation will not be recorded in the recurring job itself, and its next execution time will not be recalculated from this running.  For example, if you have a weekly job that runs on Wednesday, and you manually trigger it on Friday it will run on the following Wednesday.  

.. code-block:: c#

   RecurringJob.Trigger("some-id");

The ``RecurringJob`` class is a facade for the ``RecurringJobManager`` class. If you want some more power and responsibility, consider using it:

.. code-block:: c#

   var manager = new RecurringJobManager();
   manager.AddOrUpdate("some-id", Job.FromExpression(() => Method()), Cron.Yearly);
